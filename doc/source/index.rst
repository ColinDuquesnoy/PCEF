Welcome to pyqode.core's API reference documentation!
=====================================================

**pyqode.core** is the core framework of the `pyQode`_ project. It contains the
base classes and a set of extensions (modes/panels/managers) that you can use
to create a specialised code editor. It also provides a basic generic code
editor that you can use as a fallback when there is no specialised editor for
a given language.
