Examples
=========
If you downloaded a source archive or cloned PCEF from github, these examples
will be located in the examples subdirectory of the project's root. Examples can be run without installation by running
the following scripts (found at the project's root):

- run_generic_example.py

If you installed pcef using pip, examples are installed as gui scripts. Run the following commands in your terminal:

- pcef_generic_example

.. note:: On windows, you will need to append *c:\\Python27\\Scripts* to your path to be able to execute the gui_scripts.
