Pull Requests are great (on the dev branch)!

Readme/Documentation changes are ok in the master branch.

   1) Fork the Repo on github.
   2) Add your name to AUTHORS.txt
   3) Push to your fork and submit a pull request to the dev branch.

The master branch is used for the stable releases, following the
[git workflow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)

Please use **PEP8** to style your code (PEP8 compliance is tested by the test
suite on Travis CI).

The only allowed exceptions to **PEP8** are names of overriden methods of
Qt base classes.

Use the issue tracker to report bugs, open feature requests or ask questions.
